topic: Seasonal Impact on Fuel Inventories

# Write your research question, following one of the three allowed templates.
# Be sure your question is all on one line.
RQ: Is there correlation between East.Coast.Ethanol.Stocks...Thousand.Barrels and U.S..Gasoline.Stocks..Thousand.Barrels?

# Write your independent and dependent variables.  These should be the
# column names (reported by R colnames() where these variables are
# found in your dataset's CSV file.
# Note: if your question is about comparison of means, medians, or
# proportions, the independent variable column is the one that
# contains the values (at least two) that divide the population into
# subsets.
independent-var:  East.Coast.Ethanol.Stocks...Thousand.Barrels.
dependent-var: U.S..Gasoline.Stocks..Thousand.Barrels.

# Write the null hypothesis for your research question, again ensuring it is all on one line.
null-hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between seasonal patterns and correlations among fuel stocks on U.S. fuel inventories.

# Write the alternative hypothesis for your research question, again ensuring it is all on one line.
alt-hypothesis: Seasonal patterns and correlations among fuel stocks significantly influence U.S. fuel inventories.

# Write the dataset URL.

# Write the dataset CSV filename, exactly as it appears on the Sharepoint list
# (which should be the same as the one in your repository!)
